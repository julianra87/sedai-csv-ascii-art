## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/julianra87/sedai-csv-ascii-art.git
   cd sedai-csv-ascii-art
   ```

2. **Build and Package**

   Use Maven to package the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

   This will generate a `.jar` file in the `target/` directory.

3. **Run the Application**

   If you're providing a prebuilt `.jar` file, share it as a downloadable asset. Users can download it and run it like this:

   ```bash
   java -jar sedai-csv-ascii-art-1.0.jar
   ```

   Or if built locally:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/sedai-csv-ascii-art-1.0.jar
   ```

4. **Dependencies**

   Make sure to include the following in your `pom.xml`:
    - Lombok
    - Apache Commons Lang

   See the full dependency list in the `README` above.

##  Usage

Upon initial runs of the solution, I found that there were some entries with latitude and longitude outside of known ranges for UK locations, here is one entry as an example:
`1538687,BN91 9AA,99.999999000000000,0.000000000000000`

Based on those findings, I decided to add an additional case handling for the application to process 2 difference CSV files:

1. **Original CSV File**: This file contains tuples of latitude and longitude corresponding to UK postal zip codes. It may include some entries with placeholder coordinates (latitude `99.999999000000000` and longitude `0.000000000000000`), which are outside of known ranges for UK locations and may distort the ASCII art output, but adhere to the requested solution.

2. **Cleaned CSV File**: For optimal results, use a cleaned version of the file where entries with invalid latitude and longitude values (as mentioned above) are removed. These invalid entries cause the rendered ASCII map to become distorted and shift out of the true geographical boundaries of the UK.

I recommend preprocessing the original file to filter out these problematic entries before running the application.

To run the application with the `clean` version of the csv, you should specify the word `clean`
as program argument.
